If there is a tie for lowest-voted candidate, whichever has the least next preference votes must be eliminated. This process of elimination and redistribution continues until a candidate has a majority of valid votes in favor, and this candidate is the winner of the election and takes office.

    1. After the 48 hour voting period, a government official must post a message starting with "Recall Result" is to be posted in #citizen-announcements and containing the result of the vote.

    1. If an elected position is vacated either through recall or resignation, a new election must be held to fill the position for the rest of the original term.  
4. There are three Judges, each elected to three month terms, staggered so that there is one election per month. The Mayor is elected to a two month term, staggered slightly to avoid coinciding with a Judge election.
