    1. <span id="II-E-2b"></span>Cast votes may rank candidates from the voter's most to least preferred and do not require all candidates to be ranked. When counted, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated, with the votes cast for them going to each ballot’s next preferred candidate, or if there is no other preferred candidate the ballot is removed from consideration. If there is a tie for lowest-voted candidate, whichever has the least next preference votes must be eliminated. This process of elimination and redistribution continues until a candidate has a majority of valid votes in favor, and this candidate is the winner of the election and takes office.  
    1. After the voting period has ended, a government official is to post a message starting with "Election Results" to the #citizen-announcements channel and naming the winner of the election as determined in [II.E.2b](#II-E-2b).

    1. Any registered voter may cast or edit their vote any time within 48 hours of the Recall message.  
    1. After the 48 hour voting period, a government official must post a message starting with "Recall Result" is to be posted in #citizen-announcements and containing the result of the vote. If a 2/3rds majority of valid votes cast in favor are in support of recalling, the position is immediately vacated.  
    1. If an elected position is vacated either through recall or resignation, a new election must be held to fill the position for the rest of the original term.  
4. There are three Judges, each elected to three month terms, staggered so that there is one election per month. The Mayor is elected to a two month term, staggered slightly to avoid coinciding with a Judge election.
